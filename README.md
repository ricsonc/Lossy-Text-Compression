Lossy-Text-Compression
======================

Image compression is often accomplished by taking the two dimensional discrete cosine transform of each channel of the image. A similar technique is used here in order to simulate the compression of text.

The compression algorithm is lossy, which can be detrimental when used to compress text. Therefore, this is likely not a practical method of compressing text.

However, one interesting question that can be asked is what assignment of letters to integers will produce the most readable text after compression.
